# üß† AI-Powered Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

This project is a deep learning‚Äìbased application that classifies brain MRI scans into four categories:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

It uses a **ResNet18** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on MRI datasets and is deployed through a **Flask web interface** for easy use.

## üîß Tech Stack
- Python, Flask
- PyTorch, Torchvision
- ResNet18 / CNN
- HTML (Jinja2 templating)
- MRI Brain Tumor Dataset

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Locally
